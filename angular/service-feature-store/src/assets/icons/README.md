### Notes for using svg

For using svg you have to use SvgComponent, like in example below.

`<app-svg [src]="'assets/icons/damage/damage_coating_level_00.svg'"></app-svg>`

But you need to make sure you're importing SharedModule first.

Styles that apply to svgs can be found in src/styles/svg.scss.
