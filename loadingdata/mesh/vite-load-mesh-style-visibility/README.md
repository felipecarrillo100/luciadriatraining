## Loading Meshes

LuciadRIA offers robust capabilities for loading high-resolution meshes, enabling the display of intricate 3D data. This data can originate from real-world scans or be generated through CAD software, providing flexibility in visualization.

To facilitate this, LuciadRIA employs the OGC 3D Tiles protocol, a widely-recognized standard that enables efficient streaming of 3D data from a server to a web client. The protocol optimizes performance by dividing the 3D model into a grid of tiles. As the viewer's camera zooms in, higher resolution tiles are progressively loaded, ensuring a seamless and detailed visual experience.

In LuciadRIA, the representation of 3D data follows the standard pattern of using a model and a layer:

- [TileSet3DLayer Documentation](https://dev.luciad.com/portal/productDocumentation/LuciadRIA/docs/reference/LuciadRIA/classes/_luciad_ria_view_tileset_TileSet3DLayer.TileSet3DLayer.html)

## Creating a Mesh Layer

To create a mesh layer, you must initialize the `OGC3DTilesModel` using a slightly different approach. Since the class constructor is private, you must use the `create` method to instantiate the model.

The `create` method performs a server query to gather all necessary information for model initialization. It returns a promise, allowing for asynchronous operations and ensuring that the model is fully prepared before use. Below is an example of how to implement this:

```typescript
//  Creater the model
OGC3DTilesModel.create(url, {}).then((model: OGC3DTilesModel) => {
    // Create a layer for the model
    const layer = new TileSet3DLayer(model, {
        label: "Mesh Layer",
    });

    // Add the model to the map
    map.layerTree.addChild(layer);

    // Zoom to the layer bounds
    map.mapNavigator.fit({ bounds: layer.bounds, animate: true });
});
```
### Styling Mesh Data

The `TileSet3DLayer` in LuciadRIA offers a comprehensive suite of styling options, allowing you to customize the visual presentation of your 3D data to meet specific aesthetic and functional needs. By adjusting these styles, you can enhance the clarity, emphasis, and overall impact of your visualizations.

To apply a custom style to your mesh data, you can configure the `meshStyle` property of the `TileSet3DLayer` as follows:

```typescript
layer.meshStyle = YOUR_CUSTOM_STYLE;
```

For detailed instructions on defining and applying these styles, please refer to the [MeshStyle interface documentation](https://dev.luciad.com/portal/productDocumentation/LuciadRIA/docs/reference/LuciadRIA/interfaces/_luciad_ria_view_style_MeshStyle.MeshStyle.html). Additionally, you can explore this [article on styling mesh data](https://dev.luciad.com/portal/productDocumentation/LuciadRIA/docs/articles/howto/ogc3dtiles/styling_mesh_data.html?subcategory=ria_ogc3dtiles) for more insights.

These resources provide in-depth guidance on various visual parameters you can adjust, such as color, transparency, and other visual effects.

By leveraging these styling capabilities, LuciadRIA empowers developers to create immersive and interactive 3D visualizations. These visualizations are ideal for a wide range of applications, from detailed urban planning models to dynamic virtual simulations, enhancing both user experience and the practical utility of the data presented.
