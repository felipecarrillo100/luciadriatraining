# Introduction to Raster Data in Geospatial Applications

Raster data is a type of geospatial data that represents spatial information as a matrix of cells or pixels, organized into rows and columns. Each cell in this grid contains a value that represents a specific attribute or measurement for that location, such as color, temperature, elevation, or land cover.

### Key Features of Raster Data:

- **Grid Structure**: Raster data is composed of a grid of cells, each with a uniform size. This grid structure allows for straightforward data processing and analysis.

- **Spatial Resolution**: The size of each cell determines the spatial resolution of the raster data. Smaller cells provide higher resolution and more detailed data, while larger cells cover more area with less detail.

- **Data Representation**: Raster data is well-suited for representing continuous data, such as temperature gradients or elevation changes. It can also represent categorical data, like land use classifications.

- **Common Formats**: Raster data is often stored in formats such as TIFF, JPEG, and PNG, or more specialized formats like GeoTIFF, which includes georeferencing information.

### Applications of Raster Data:

- **Remote Sensing**: Satellite imagery is a prime example of raster data, capturing detailed views of the Earth's surface. It is used extensively for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and urban planning.

- **Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)**: These raster datasets represent the Earth's surface elevation and are used in terrain analysis, flood modeling, and infrastructure planning.

- **Climate and Weather Analysis**: Raster data is essential for modeling and visualizing climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns.

- **Street Mapping**: Raster data is also used in street mapping applications, providing detailed background imagery for navigation systems and geographic information systems (GIS). This includes the visualization of street networks and urban infrastructure.

Overall, raster data is a crucial component of geospatial analysis, providing a flexible and powerful means of representing and analyzing spatial phenomena across a wide range of applications, from satellite imagery to street mapping.

LuciadRIA offers support for raster-based services, including WMS (Web Map Service), WMTS (Web Map Tile Service), and LTS (Luciad Tile Service). In this document, we will concentrate specifically on WMS. However, the concepts and techniques discussed can also be applied to WMTS and LTS.
